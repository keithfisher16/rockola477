This project presents a hardware and software solution to replace the credit board in Rock-Ola 477 jukeboxes. This board is often defective in these boxes and cannot usually be repaired due to the custom chips it contains.

[My website](http://jim.hawkridges.co.uk/projects/juke/) describes my jukebox in more detail.
